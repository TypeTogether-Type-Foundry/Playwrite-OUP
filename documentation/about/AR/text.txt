Primary school curricula In Argentina focuses on writing mostly from a comprehension and composition standpoint, rather than from the perspective of handwriting. Even so, primary school students learn how to write with joined upright cursive letters from first or second grade. In the initial level, students learn print uppercase letters, followed by print lowercase letters in the first grade, and finally, cursive writing.

Playwrite Argentina characteristics
As it happens in many South American countries, handwriting for primary education is rooted in the tradition of French Normal schools. It is a round, continuous cursive style, and some of its most recognizable features are the long ascenders and descender loops, semi-connected uppercase letters, curved entry strokes on x-height, the knot in the letter 'o', and a crossbar in 'q' that requires a pen lift.
