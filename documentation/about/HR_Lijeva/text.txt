The seeds for standardisation of Croatian handwriting education were sown in 2007 when the Ministry of Education promoted a series of research projects that yielded numerous resources focused on Croatian language education, particularly for reading and writing. Among these was a handbook for handwriting education by Ante Bežen and Siniša Reberski, a work that was influential in the standardisation of handwriting instruction from 2013 onwards. In first grade, students match letters with sounds, and learn to recognise them in the context of words by means of print style letters. From second grade, students must write using a continuous and fully joined cursive called rukopisno pismo.

This model presents a vertical continuous cursive tailored for left-handed students, who might find slanted writing challenging. It features short, looped ascenders and descenders. The uppercase letters are subtly decorative, and some are designed to enhance connecting strokes. Interestingly, the lowercase 'm' and 'n' lack a curved entry stroke, while 'r', 'v', 'w', and 'y' include one. The formation of these letters is deliberate, rounded, and meticulous.
