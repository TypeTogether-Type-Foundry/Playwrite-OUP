Instruction happens during the early years of primary education, specifically in preparatory, first, and second grades. While schools and teachers have some flexibility in their methods, the instruction process, its stages and writing models are widely standardised.

This slanted continuous cursive features a slow stroke speed and medium-length, looped ascenders and descenders. The uppercase letters are decorative, highlighted by a straight spine in 'S' and a distinguishable shape in 'G'. Both capital and lowercase versions of 'X' and 'Z' include crossbars as a unifying stylistic element. The lowercase letters often incorporate knots, enhancing the complex appearance of the script. The letter 'f' has a loopless descender and connects to the next letter via its crossbar, while 'q' is notable for a short exit stroke in its descender.
