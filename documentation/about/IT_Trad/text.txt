Italy holds an important place in the historical development of handwriting styles. Handwriting produced in the Latin script finds its roots in the models produced during the Italian Renaissance. The most prevalent form of handwriting taught in Italy is an upright cursive style developed in the early to mid 20th century, which, according to handwriting expert Francesco Ascoli, was prescribed in the countryâ€™s national guidelines in 1945.

At the beginning of the 21st century, the decline in the quality of handwriting in Italy caught the attention of the educational community. To rectify this situation, educators and handwriting experts started to explore different ways to improve instruction in primary schools by revamping approaches and resources for traditional handwriting education, or introducing new teaching schemes. Among the latter, the Scrittura Corsiva project has gained significant recognition.

This is an upright, fully joined, modern cursive, featuring short ascenders and descenders. It utilizes simplified print-style capital letters. Distinctive identity traits include a serifed 'I' and an 'M' with splain legs. Lowercase letters 'f', 'g', 'j', and 'y' employ descender loops to seamlessly connect to the next letter. Both 'p' and 'b' are designed with closed bowls, 'k' is constructed with two strokes, and 'f' is notable for the absence of its top loop, creating a clearly recognizable handwriting model.
