Even though writing may be introduced in preschool, systematic teaching of handwriting only happens in 1° Cycle. Since schools have pedagogic autonomy in Portugal, there are differences in how handwriting is taught. Though it should be noted that they must meet the curriculum goals set out by the government and are subject to periodic external evaluations. Schools usually begin with letra impressa, or print script letters, starting with capital letters for students aged 5–6 years old, before moving to a fully joined, vertical cursive writing, known as escrita vertical. There are also some traditional schools that start handwriting teaching with letra de mão/manuscrita, or cursive letters from the beginning.

Playwrite Portugal Characteristics
This upright continuous cursive model features decorative capital letters, with a notably distinctive 'Q' and an 'S' with a vertical stem. The lowercase letters are constructed slowly and carefully, displaying medium-length, looped ascenders and descenders. Letters 'm', 'n', 'v', and 'w' begin with curved entry strokes, while 'z' is characterized by a flat top. Additionally, the letter 'f' has a mirrored descender loop, and the letters 'o', 'v', 'w', and 'z' include knots, enhancing the stylistic intricacy of this handwriting model.
