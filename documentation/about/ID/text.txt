In 1983, a standard, national model for handwriting education was introduced by the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture through an official decree. It was updated in 2009, but the original is still preferred. According to the model, students first learn huruf lepas, or loose letters, followed by huruf sambung, or cursive letters. Across the country, handwriting is taught using this model, and it is featured in workbooks produced by popular private publishers in Indonesia.

Playwrite Indonesia Characteristics
This style uses the traditional French model as its basis. It features upright, connected cursive letters with notably long ascenders and descenders. The letters, characterized by their rounded shapes, are written slowly. Capital letters blend printed and decorative elements, notably in 'Q', 'K', and 'L'. The lowercase 'f' has a mirrored bottom loop. Letters 'm', 'n', 'v', 'w', and especially 'z', begin with a curved entry stroke. The lowercase 'b' is distinguished by a knot, and interestingly, the 's' does not adopt a cursive form.
