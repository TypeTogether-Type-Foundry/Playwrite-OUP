Due to the absence of handwriting education guidelines in the curriculum and no prescribed model, there is a great deal of diversity in the approaches to handwriting teaching. The most widespread method is to teach uppercase print style letters first and connected cursive writing second. However in some schools, student may start with cursive writing in first grade itself, and in others, cursive writing is not taught at all. An important difference is seen in private schools, where handwriting may be taught using models imported from abroad. For instance, Spanish-English bilingual schools teach using the Sassoon model that was developed in England.
