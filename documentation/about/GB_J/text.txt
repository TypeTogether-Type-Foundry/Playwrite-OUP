England has been the incubator for several prominent handwriting styles that still influence teaching around the world. One of the earliest examples would be English roundhand, which was used in business and education in the 19th century.

The implementation of modern cursive styles in classrooms is probably the most influentian development for contemporary handwriting education. They draw from the ideas of the Italic Handwriting Revival movement of the early 20th century, and the work of its proponents. Alfred Fairbank (1895–1982) proposed modern italic writing, based on chancery models, as a new approach to teaching handwriting with the aim of simplification and faster writing speed. In recent times, it has been one of the most popular approaches to handwriting teaching in England. Of the twenty-three methods described in the National Handwriting Association’s 2013 guide to writing methods for teaching, thirteen were modern cursive styles. Important among these are Nelson Handwriting, Tom Gourdie Modern Hand, Jarman Handwriting, Marion Richardson and Sassoon-Williams model.

This fully connected modern cursive has short, loopless ascenders and com looped descenders, and is available in two flavors: uopright and slanted (or italic). It has simplified print upper cases. Their most identifiable features are the open 'G' with no crossbar, and the 'M' with splain legs. Lower case 'f' is its more recognizable feature, with an ascender that requires lifting the pen. As expected in this style, letters 'r' and 'z' have an italic cursive structure.
