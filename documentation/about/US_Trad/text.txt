In the absence of a unified national approach, elementary education in the United States is supported by several private companies that espouse different approaches to teaching handwriting. According to American handwriting expert Kate Gladstone, it is difficult to confidently determine which handwriting models are most commonly taught in the country, but among the most widespread are Zaner-Bloser, D’Nealian, and Handwriting Without Tears. Two other programs — Getty-Dubay and Barchowsky Fluent Hand — are rapidly gaining interest as writing models not only for children but also for adults seeking to improve their handwriting.

Playwrite USA Traditional Characteristics
This style follows the traditional American style of Zaner-Bloser and D'Nealian, featuring a slanted continuous cursive. Capital letters vary in their appearance, with some like 'I', 'H', and 'G' being more decorative, and others such as 'A', 'N', and 'M' maintaining a cursive style. The construction of the letters appears fast and is complex in certain characters. Ascenders and descenders include loops to facilitate continuous writing, with mirrored loops in 'p' and 'q' enhancing the flow. Consistent with other English-speaking models, the entry strokes for 'v' and 'w' are distinctly different.
