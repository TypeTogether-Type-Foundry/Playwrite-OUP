The seeds for standardisation of Croatian handwriting education were sown in 2007 when the Ministry of Education promoted a series of research projects that yielded numerous resources focused on Croatian language education, particularly for reading and writing. Among these was a handbook for handwriting education by Ante Bežen and Siniša Reberski, a work that was influential in the standardisation of handwriting instruction from 2013 onwards. In first grade, students match letters with sounds, and learn to recognise them in the context of words by means of print style letters. From second grade, students must write using a continuous and fully joined cursive called rukopisno pismo.

Playwrite Hrvatska Characteristics
This is a slanted continuous cursive handwriting model with short looped ascenders and descenders. The uppercase letters are slightly decorative, with some designed to facilitate connecting strokes. Distinctively, the lowercase letters 'm' and 'n' do not have a curved entry stroke, whereas 'r', 'v', 'w', and 'y' do. The construction of these letters is characterized by a slow, rounded, and careful approach.
