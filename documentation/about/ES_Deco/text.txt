Primary school handwriting in Spain features letters that are cursive from a structural standpoint but have no slant. These upright cursive letters are either taught in the form of a hybrid style, which uses joined cursive lowercase letters with unjoined simplified print uppercase, or as a fully cursive style, which features ornate, and more traditional cursive uppercase letters. The hybrid style is used in textbooks by major educational publishers, such as Cuadernos Rubio, Santillana Educaci칩n, Editorial Barcanova, and Tekman Education.

This continuous cursive is influenced by traditional French models and features medium-length ascenders and descenders with loops. Several lowercase letters begin with curved entry strokes, and some incorporate knots. The 'z' is uniquely styled in italic fashion, which stands out in this script. In contrast to its more simplified sibling, this model boasts cursive-style capital letters. Notably, the 'X' includes a double knot and the 'T' is distinguished by a decorative crossbar.
