In The Netherlands, handwriting education commonly begins in Groep 3 after students have learned fine and gross motor skills in previous years. The most commonly used handwriting model in classrooms is verbonden schrift, a slanted continuous cursive with loops. However, teachers have increasingly opted for blokschrift, which features unjoined, simplified print letters. Some teachers choose to instruct in both models: one after another, together, or in a permutation that suits their students.

This slanted fully joined handwriting style includes cursive uppercases, with the exception of 'S', and features complex shapes in letters such as 'I' and 'J'. The lowercase letters showcase long ascenders and descenders, each furnished with loops, enhancing the fluidity of the script. Curved entry strokes are present in letters 'm', 'n', 'v', 'w', 'x', and 'y', contributing to the overall smooth and flowing appearance. The letter 'z' stands out as it is specifically constructed in an italic style, adding a distinct contrast within the script.
