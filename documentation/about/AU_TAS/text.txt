All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its own version of this style, locally known as “script”, and state-level departments of education offer guidelines, and in some cases resources, for schools and teachers.

The adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990, when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same source, today the five main handwriting models have diverged somewhat in their details.

This semi-connected, slanted modern cursive features print-style capital letters. The lowercase letters are loopless, and characters with descenders, as well as the letter 's', do not connect to the following letter, allowing for faster writing. The style is characterized by a high stroke speed. Notably, the letter 'G' is open, and 'Y' has a peculiar design. The 'f' is disconnected with a curved descender. The letters 'b' and 'p' have closed bowls, while 'r' and 'z' are presented in an italic style. Additionally, 'q' finishes with a small exit stroke, contributing to the fluidity and distinctiveness of this handwriting style.
