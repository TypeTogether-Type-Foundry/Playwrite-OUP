The Colombian cursive style ‘letra pegada’ is visibly rooted in the traditions of the Palmer method, created by Austin Palmer (1860–1927) in the United States at the turn of the last century. It has many similarities with cursive writing models in North American countries (United States, México, and Canada), which also descend from the same style. This influence can be seen in the ‘cartillas’ or handwriting education booklets produced by private publishers, which play an essential role in the teaching of reading and writing in the country. 

Playwrite Colombia characteristics
Following the tradition and current use of these booklets, Playwrite Colombia is a very slanted continuous cursive. Its lowercase letters have medium-length ascenders and descenders with loops that favor writing whole words without pen lifts. Based on the Palmer style, these loops are mirrored in the descending strokes of letters ‘f’ and ‘q’. Some uppercase letters, such as the ‘G’, ‘L’ and ‘Z’, have decorative and complex cursive shapes.
