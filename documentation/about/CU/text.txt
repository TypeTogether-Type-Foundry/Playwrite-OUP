Literacy education in Cuba is notable for its distinctive approach: students are introduced to two different styles of letters from the outset, one for reading and the other for writing. Textbooks feature print-style, typographic letters represented by either geometric or grotesque sans serifs for reading. These styles are consistent across all workbooks and textbooks, with the exception of those focused on writing and calligraphy. For these, a fully-joined, cursive style is used, drawing inspiration from calligraphic models from the United States, notably the Palmer Method, created by Austin Palmer , and the Zaner-Bloser method, developed by Charles Paxton Zaner and his partner Elmer Ward Bloser.

Playwrite Cuba Characteristics
This style is a very slanted continuous cursive that draws inspiration from the Zaner-Bloser and D'Nealian models. It features cursive uppercase letters, some of which are quite complex, such as 'I', 'J', and 'G'. The lowercase letters have medium-length extenders with loops, present even in letters like 'p' and 'q', and are formed using slow strokes. Notably, this style includes an italic-style 'r' and a 'z' with a flat top and a loop.
