All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its own version of this style, locally known as “script”, and state-level departments of education offer guidelines, and in some cases resources, for schools and teachers.

The adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990, when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same source, today the five main handwriting models have diverged somewhat in their details.

This modern cursive includes elements of continuous cursive styles, such as the open bowls in 'b' and 'p'. The only loop is on the ascender of 'f', while 'm' and 'n' feature curved entry strokes. Letters with descenders, except for 'f', do not connect to the next letter, giving a more distinct and clear semi-connected appearance. The 'z' has a very open design with a descender. In line with other Australian models, 'g' also features an open design. 'M' is noted for its plain legs, and 'q' ends with a small exit stroke.
