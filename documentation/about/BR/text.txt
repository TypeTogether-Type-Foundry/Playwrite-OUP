Educational Vertical cursive models first appeared in the 19th century in France, England and USA as simplified forms of their predecessors, Roundhand and Spencerian styles, respectively. The upright cursive writing did not enjoy a long period of popularity in northern European and Anglo-American countries. It was, however, widely adopted in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and France, where it is still used. From these countries, it travelled to erstwhile colonies such as Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, among others. In Brazil, this resulted in the replacement of the then-popular models of handwriting, such as Palmer from the US and commercial roundhand script from England, with the vertical cursive approach.
