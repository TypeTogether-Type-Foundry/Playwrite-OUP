England has been the incubator for several prominent handwriting styles that still influence teaching around the world. One of the earliest examples would be English roundhand, which was used in business and education in the 19th century.

The implementation of modern cursive styles in classrooms is probably the most influentian development for contemporary handwriting education. They draw from the ideas of the Italic Handwriting Revival movement of the early 20th century, and the work of its proponents. Alfred Fairbank (1895–1982) proposed modern italic writing, based on chancery models, as a new approach to teaching handwriting with the aim of simplification and faster writing speed. In recent times, it has been one of the most popular approaches to handwriting teaching in England. Of the twenty-three methods described in the National Handwriting Association’s 2013 guide to writing methods for teaching, thirteen were modern cursive styles. Important among these are Nelson Handwriting, Tom Gourdie Modern Hand, Jarman Handwriting, Marion Richardson and Sassoon-Williams model.

Playwrite England SemiJoined Characteristics
This semi-connected modern cursive is offered in both upright and slanted (italic) versions. It features short, loopless ascenders and descenders, with simplified print-like uppercase letters. Notable characteristics include an open 'G' without a crossbar and an 'M' with plain legs. The lowercase 'f' has a curved descending stroke, and the 'q' is distinguished by a flick in its descender. True to this style, there are no curved entry strokes, and letters ending in a right-to-left stroke, such as 'b', 'p', 'g', and 's', do not connect to the following letter.
