In the absence of a unified national approach, elementary education in the United States is supported by several private companies that espouse different approaches to teaching handwriting. According to American handwriting expert Kate Gladstone, it is difficult to confidently determine which handwriting models are most commonly taught in the country, but among the most widespread are Zaner-Bloser, D’Nealian, and Handwriting Without Tears. Two other programs — Getty-Dubay and Barchowsky Fluent Hand — are rapidly gaining interest as writing models not only for children but also for adults seeking to improve their handwriting.

Playwrite USA Modern Characteristics
This style is a straightforward, completely upright modern cursive. The uppercase letters adopt a simplified print style, with notable features including a serif on 'I' and an 'M' with a raised center. The lowercase letters are semi-connected and designed with loopless, medium-length ascenders and descenders. Unusually for this style, the letters 'm', 'n', and 'r' begin with a curved entry stroke, which adds a subtle complexity to the otherwise streamlined appearance of the script.
