In 2019, the Ministry of Children and Education outlined the government's primary education requirements in a document called "Danish Common Goals". It specifies that second grade students must be able to write upper and lowercase letters by hand and using the keyboard, and by fourth grade, they are expected to write in legible, connected handwriting. Accordingly, handwriting instruction starts during preschool with simplified print letters. Given the autonomy to choose their preferred teaching methods and models, teachers and schools opt between two cursive models during the middle of second or the beginning of third year — the unlooped Grundskrift, or its looped variation known as Grundskrift med løkker. 

Playwrite Danmark Loopet Characteristics
This typographic hybrid draws from fully joined modern cursives but includes looped ascenders. It features a slanted orientation with short ascenders and descenders, creating a round and restrained appearance. The capital letters are mostly simplified and print-like, with a very distinctive 'G' that lacks both a descender and a crossbar. The lowercase letters connect with each other, except for 'q'. A standout feature is the lowercase 'b', which combines a modern cursive shape and connecting stroke with an uncharacteristic loop on its ascender.
