In 2019, the Ministry of Children and Education outlined the government's primary education requirements in a document called "Danish Common Goals". It specifies that second grade students must be able to write upper and lowercase letters by hand and using the keyboard, and by fourth grade, they are expected to write in legible, connected handwriting. Accordingly, handwriting instruction starts during preschool with simplified print letters. Given the autonomy to choose their preferred teaching methods and models, teachers and schools opt between two cursive models during the middle of second or the beginning of third year — the unlooped Grundskrift, or its looped variation known as Grundskrift med løkker. 

Playwrite Danmark Uloopet Characteristics
This slanted modern cursive features no loops, creating a streamlined appearance with short ascenders and descenders. It maintains a round and restrained look. The capital letters are largely simplified and print-like, highlighted by a distinctive 'G' that lacks both a descender and a crossbar. Lowercase letters with descenders, such as 'g' and 'y', do not connect to the following letter, and 'm' and 'n' start without a curved entry stroke. Despite its italic structure, 'b' and 'p' are designed with connecting strokes.
