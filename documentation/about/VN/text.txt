In Vietnam, an official handwriting model for teaching in primary schools was adopted in 2002. It is called the mẫu chữ thảo tiếng việt, or Vietnamese official cursive script, and has been in use from academic year 2002-03 onwards. Based on this model, students learn to write in both upright and (optionally) sloped cursive letters, without ever being taught print letters. Nevertheless, they do practice drawing the basic strokes that make up letters in preparation. Handwriting education happens between Grades 1 to 3, and while students are introduced to writing using a pencil, they graduate to writing with fountain pens while they are still in primary school.

Playwrite VN  characteristics
The model follows the structure and proportions of the upright, monolinear version of the Vietnamese official cursive script. These are the versions that are prioritised for teaching, while others may be introduced if the situation is conducive. The letter shapes derive from the French traditional vertical cursive writing, featuring long ascenders and descenders and round and fully joined lowercases. Letters 'b', 'r', 'v', and 'w' make use of knots to change the stroke direction, 'n' and 'm' have curved entry strokes and 'x' is created by means of two mirrored curves. Notable upper case features are the triangular yet decorative shapes of 'A', 'V' and 'W', and an 'S' with an upright spine.
