All Australian provinces employ modern cursive letters for handwriting education, which are taught in a progressive manner. But each state teaches its own version of this style, locally known as “script”, and state-level departments of education offer guidelines, and in some cases resources, for schools and teachers.

The adoption of the current models and approach can be traced back to 1990, when the Australian Education Council (AEC) recommended that all schools in the country should adopt a handwriting style based on Scottish calligrapher Tom Gourdie’s Simple Modern Hand. The AEC advocated for a consistent style in handwriting instruction across the country so students relocating across states and territories would not face difficulties. Despite starting from the same source, today the five main handwriting models have diverged somewhat in their details.

Playwrite Australia QLD Characteristics
This semi-connected, slanted modern cursive features print-style capital letters. The extenders are loopless, and letters with descenders do not connect to the next letter, allowing for a fluid and fast writing pace. Notably, 'm' and 'n' start with curved entry strokes. Distinctive features include an open 'G' without a crossbar and a serifed 'I', adding a unique touch. The 'Y' is peculiar in its form. The lowercase 'f' is disconnected and features a straight descender. The 'q' concludes with a short exit stroke, while the 's' maintains a cursive style. The 'z' is designed to be wide and open with a descender, enhancing readability and style.
