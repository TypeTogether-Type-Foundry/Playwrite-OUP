The Austrian Elementary School Curriculum, updated in 2003, stipulates that by the end of the second grade, students should achieve legible and fluent handwriting based on the Österreichische Schulschrift, or Austrian school script. This model was originally created in 1946 drawing upon the foundations of German Sütterlinschrift, but underwent several reforms before its last version was introduced in 1995.

Playwrite Österreich characteristics
This cursive style, available in upright and slanted versions, features oval foundational forms and medium-length extenders. It favors fast writing and it is mostly joined, but some letters with crossbars require pen lifts. Uppercase letters are cursive and semi-joined. Notable shapes include Kurrent-style “t”, an 'f' with loopless descender, a crossbar in 'Z' and knots in certain lower cases.
