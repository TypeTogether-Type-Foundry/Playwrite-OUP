The most prevalent style of handwriting taught in Chile is known as letra ligada, or joined letters. This form of cursive handwriting is introduced to children as early as 6 years old, either alongside print letters or as a standalone style. It can be seen as a slantless variant of English roundhand, a calligraphic style that emerged in England, gaining widespread popularity in the 18th century, but Chilean type designers note that, while there are structural similarities between the two styles, there are also notable differences. For instance, letra ligada typically features shorter ascenders and descenders, and its uppercase letters are less ornate. This divergence is present in both contemporary typographic and calligraphic examples.

This upright continuous cursive features a mix of uppercase styles. Letters like 'A' and 'N' are plain and cursive, whereas others such as 'Q' and 'T' are more decorative and intricate. The lowercase letters have medium-length extenders with loops and are characterized by their rounded forms and slow stroke speed. The letter 'q' is distinguished by a mirrored loop on its descender. The 'o' includes a knot, and the letters 'm', 'n', 'v', 'w', 'y', and 'z' begin with curved entry strokes.
