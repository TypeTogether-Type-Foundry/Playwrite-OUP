There are two main models used for handwriting education in the Czech Republic. The first, known as Zjednodušená psací latinka, or Simplified Latin script, is a continuous cursive hand. This model was officially ratified by the education ministry of erstwhile Czechoslovakia in 1932 and underwent its last revision in 1978. The second model, Comenia Script, features unjoined letters and was endorsed by the ministry in 2012. The national curriculum, which was last published in 2013, provides no further prescriptions about handwriting, and as a result, schools have the autonomy to select either model for instruction.

Playwrite Česko Characteristics
Based on Zjednodušená psací latinka, this slanted continuous cursive features medium to short extenders and is executed at a slow stroke speed. The capital letters maintain a cursive, mostly unadorned structure, with distinctive traits such as an unusually constructed 'Q' and a vertical spine in 'S'. Lowercase letters have loops on extenders but lack knots, with the exception of the German-style 't'. Several lowercase letters begin with curved entry strokes. The letter 'z' is styled in a plain italic form and does not have a descender.
